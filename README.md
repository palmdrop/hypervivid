# Hypervivid
**Live at** [palmdrop.site](https://palmdrop.site)

![Hypervivid - main page](/.github/images/main-page.png)

Experimental new webspace. Replacement of my [old site](https://github.com/palmdrop/webspace/edit/main/README.md), which is retired but can still be found [here.](https://webspace.pages.dev/).

The purpose of this site is, among other things, to
* learn new technologies
* explore generative/digital art 
* share thoughts, projects, links, whatever
* and connect ideas of any form.
