# Hypervivid
**Live at** [palmdrop.site](https://palmdrop.site)

![Hypervivid - main page](/.github/images/main-page.png)

Experimental new personal website. Replacement of my [old site](https://github.com/palmdrop/webspace/edit/main/README.md), which is retired but can still be found [here](https://webspace.pages.dev/).

The purpose of this site is, among other things, to
* learn new technologies
* explore generative/digital art 
* share thoughts, projects, links, whatever
* and connect ideas of any form.

# TODO
- [ ] Minimap for node navigation.
- [ ] Create "paths" that can be followed across the site.
- [ ] Optimize landing page (force graph is too taxing for some devices).
- [ ] Upgrade SvelteKit once Cloudflare pages support is introduced.
- [ ] Introduce "artifacts": sub-node structures such as images, quotes, links, etc, that can be used in the site node graph structure.
