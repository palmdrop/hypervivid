I've gathered links and pieces from places I find on the internet for a while now, both privately and publicly. Personal bookmarks, collections of documents, hyperlinks, and notes. There's too much to remember. Everything is too large and complex.

I've written before about the *small internet* versus the *internet of platforms*, one being a distributed collection of personal sites and the other the large platforms that now permeate daily internet use.

(Check the [manifesto page](/nodes/manifesto) for some more of these thoughts.)

Sharing links is a dying practice. The *old internet* was filled with [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) and personal public bookmarks. The concept of the hyperlink was new and fresh and without fancy search engines, sharing was the only way of traversing the web.

Search engines are not neutral. Tracking is real. Some spaces cannot be found without someone showing you the way.

Here's a site dedicated to this practice: [a website is a room](https://a-website-is-a-room.net/), and [here's my personal set of hyperlinks](/nodes/links).
