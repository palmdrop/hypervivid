I recently developed a node-based programming application for the web. I gave it the semi-pretentious title "Substrates" even though there's a web3 project with a similar name, which I'll ignore. 

I tend to use noise and domain-warping in most of my generative art. Substrates allows me to play around with these effects using a graphical interface, instead of editing code directly. This makes it easier to edit the shaders and see the results live, play around with new configurations, and save the experiments in a simple format (JSON).

Why develop a node-based programming application when there's better software already out there, such as TouchDesigner? 

Because I wanted the thing to be web-based. I wanted to build it myself. It primarily exists for me -- I use it to create texture, complex domain warping effects, backgrounds, displacement maps, whatever. I have full creative control. I can incorporate the code as a submodule in my web projects and render my saved node programs. I want my generative art to be viewable from anywhere by anyone, living natively on the web. This allows me to not only share documentation of my art (images, videos) but the art itself: the code running live in the browser. There's beauty in not just showing cherry-picked, dead fragments. Even though I occasionally post on Instagram, I aim to have everything living here, on this page.

And in the process, I also learned a lot about JS/HTML/CSS and Svelte.

See my old [alien patterns](/nodes/alien-patterns) for insight on some of the code and general shader development techniques. If you want some example programs, consider the ["programs" folder of the repository of this website](https://github.com/palmdrop/hypervivid/tree/main/src/assets/programs). The sub-folders hold JSON-files that can be loaded into *Substrates* using the "load" button. Click on some nodes and change the settings. Make some new connections. See what happens. But again, the software mostly exists for me. Documentation is lacking. There will be bugs. Still, I decided to make the thing public. I'll keep working on it whenever I feel the need.
