*Some more semi-structured thoughts about technology and digital platforms.*

We seem to be searching for new platforms. An undercurrent tugging at the web -- the desire for sincerity, slowness, autonomy. 

Too much is going on. Not about to say anything new here: We all feel the speed of cultural shifts, world events, changes of leadership, corporate internet infrastructure rebranding and rebranding again. Bundled together to the sludge. Overwhelming and anesthetizing. 

Technology is not morally neutral. Tools, platforms, patterns of interaction -- not neutral. Steam-engines, bio-engineering, and TikTok -- not neutral. The invention of algorithmic curation or AI or new chemical warfare all has inherent implications. New technologies will enable us to do things we weren't able to do before and think in new ways. Suggesting that it's up to us use the tools in responsible and rational ways is disillusioned. We are not rational, we are emotional and multi-faceted and we ought to embrace that. We are all affected by advertisements. We all live in the spectacle. It's part of us. Tools that reach mass adoption will over time become ingrained in us. Hold a hammer and a new entity is born: *you with a hammer*. Your brain will think of the tool as a part of your body. Guns don't kill people alone, but they make it a whole lot easier than killing a person with fists only. We are hasty and emotional and brilliant.

We are also adaptive. Our minds are plastic. You will merge with that hammer, your language, the digital technologies you use every day.

Most major social platforms are carefully engineered to be as engaging and addictive as possible. We know this, we even accept it. Of course they want to maximize their profits, that's how things work. Maybe we accept this because we believe we could easily look away, choose something else, if we really wanted to. The tech is neutral, we just use it wrong. This thinking will snare us in doom scrolling while we blame ourselves. The feed is just the feed. It does what it does.

The result is minds optimized for interacting with algorithmically curated platforms. The usage patterns that drive profit become part of our minds. It shapes how we think, how we do culture and politics and relationships. And at the same time, ["third places" (places for social interaction outside the home and the workplace)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ku9csXhvJY) are disappearing. We have nowhere to go but social platforms.

# are.na
There are quite a few social platforms out there that try to do things in another way. Platforms that reject algorithmic curation, advertisement models, and data collecting. Healthier places on the web. Few of these platforms gain major traction. However, recently more and more people have been gravitating towards (are.na)[https://are.na]. I think one ought to be skeptical towards the advertised philosophies of digital companies, or any company, but I do think are.na is not only a step in the right direction with regards to the philosophy of its creators, but also in inherent platform structure.

Are.na has no ads, no infinite feed, no algorithmic curation, no suggestions, and no ranking. Not even likes. It's a platform for organizing digital artifacts such as images, texts, links, PDFs, videos, whatever. The core concept is built on *blocks* and *channels*. A block contains a single digital artifact, often an image. A channel may contain any number of blocks. On the surface, this is not more than a basic folder structure. Create a folder, and put some files in it. The difference is how channels and blocks are connected. A block may be added to many channels. A channel may be nested in many other channels. Links between blocks and channels are bi-directional. From any block or channel, you can find any channel that includes it. From any channel, you can (obviously) find all included blocks or nested channels. Are.na is a huge node graph with a user-controlled structure. The interface is scaled down -- it does not impose any specific usage pattern. Are.na used works well for research purposes, mood boards, aesthetic explorations, and artistic experiments.

There is a feed, but only to display the latest updates to channels or users you follow. It quickly dries up. The best way to explore are.na is to traverse the graph. Find a channel, explore the blocks, backtrack to find other channels connecting these blocks, and keep going. Are.na makes me think of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), an early vision for how (digital) documents and other pieces of information could be stored and connected. 

I believe are.na encourages a way of thinking much different from the existing major digital platforms. It's social, but also slow, unsensational, reflective. Blocks are not owned, they are just nodes, free to be connected. Thoughts, images, and *vibes* from many different sources are open for exploration and connection. Using are.na feels ambient, slow. Browsing a user profile is intimate. You see what they see, what they find beautiful, what they are thinking about. 

Even disregarding the are.na marketing, which promotes deep thinking, slow living, a resistance to commercialism, the very structure of the platform promotes these ideals. Are.na feels like a [smooth space](https://www.christianhubert.com/writing/smoothstriated) that encourages a type of ["fuzzy" thinking](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/artists/doesnt-produce-anxiety-meet-na-social-network-created-artists-10207/).

I try to remain vigilant. Many platforms ["conquer before they commodify"](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/deleuze-for-developers-will-smooth-spaceopen-source-suffice-to-save-us). But I do hope are.na will stay the way it is, and there are some positive signs. The are.na code is open source, the API public. Minimal updates suggest stability. Users have to pay for a subscription to get infinite blocks and channels, which indicates that the platform will not have to resort to an advertisement model.

# a fuzzier internet
Still, I don't want to portray a single platform as a solution for a healthier internet. The internet at large could be like are.na. However benevolent the platform, it will still be centralized. The control of the data and interactions are not in the hands of the users. Decisions are made elsewhere. But I do hope that are.na, and platforms like it, help us start thinking in new, "fuzzier" ways. Mass appeal seems distant, though. A shift would be gradual.

I've written about things like [this](https://palmdrop.site/nodes/branches-and-connections) before, and [sketched on some ideas for an experimental browsing tool](https://palmdrop.site/nodes/maps-of-the-web?fullscreen=false), an *are.na for browsing*. I hope for an internet more like an [open field](https://zine.zora.co/arena-charles-broskoski).
