# Unfinished manifesto
> always a work in progress, like the rest of this place

Internet culture has evolved to a point where expressions of hope and sincerity feel nothing but cringe. We interact at an extreme velocity, but everything is detached. Our collective dreams are of liminal horror. A shift is needed.

As an infrastructure that is still fundamentally decentralized, the web has latent potential for enabling cultural and economical change. But we need to break from the internet of platforms: the small subset of the internet that is exclusively controlled by huge media conglomerates -- an internet that is streamlined, formulaic, and predictable, where every space is a market, every interaction a performance, and everything we create reduced to "content". 

We should foster a softer culture where explorations, sincerity, and play are integral. A place for sharing and organizing. A place that could outlive capitalism, irony poisoning, and existential dissociation -- an internet of map-making and multiplicities.

As a personal project, this site acts as an unfinished and evolving host for my digital work. It's my node on the web. A place for practicing play, connecting thoughts, and mapping out ideas.

## Digital Futures
The internet of platforms favors closed loops. When conglomerates with unfathomable resources are allowed to define what to expect from the internet, and how to use it, they can easily contain all interactions to their domain. But technology should not be solely the domain of experts and corporations. We need to lower the threshold of entry -- the web should be accessible and democratic. The people at SOFTER phrased it well: [Softer digital futures](https://softer.website/softer "a cozy place").

As for culture: irony, deconstruction and cultural paranoia make for great memes, but it's not an effective means for striving toward better futures -- it's the mentality of the end times. 
[Maybe something more hopeful is possible](https://beforewegoblog.com/purity-and-futures-of-hard-work-by-ada-palmer/), [or we should just look for new weapons.](https://cidadeinseguranca.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/deleuze_control.pdf) Sincerity is key. Irony is for deconstruction -- we also need to build.

## Internet of Play
We should welcome amateur websites, blogs, experiments, digital art projects, obscurities, the unfinished and changing. To break out of the bubble of platforms, hyperlinks are vital. We need to actively explore and broadcast our findings -- and define the map of the internet ourselves. Great projects like [Search marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/) make it easier to explore the "small" internet.

While doing this, we need to ease our vigilance towards odd layouts, rough or non-existing design, and the aesthetics of the "old internet".The current design standards are corporate: minimalist, subtle color schemes, [endlessly A-B tested for the best shade of blue](https://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html), [a psychological weaponizing of design](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3400901). "Flawlessness" is expected, and hence web design becomes unreasonably difficult. The standards should change. 

Play, try things out, explore, and link to others as you do. Embrace [ludic interfaces/designs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_interface) Experiment.

## Learning in public
["Learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) is creating, sharing, and engaging in a collective feedback loop. A way of publishing anything, finished or unfinished, good or bad, in order to evolve -- learn, interact, grow relationships.

Create as you would take notes. Share your notes. You may take notes just to forget them, but with links, you may encounter the note again, or someone else will. The internet is a collective thing, and we can shape it by map-making and plotting out associations. We could shape out what it is and what it might be.
