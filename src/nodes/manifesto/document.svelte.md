# Unfinished manifesto
> always a work in progress, like the rest of this place

Internet culture has evolved to a point where expressions of hope and sincerity feels nothing but cringe. We interact at extreme velocity, but all is detached and dissociated. Our collective dreams are of liminal horror. A shift is needed.

As infrastructure that is still fundamentally decentralized, the web has a lot of latent potential as a tool for cultural and economical change. To yield that potential we need to break out of the internet of platforms: the small subset of the internet that is exclusively controlled by huge media conglomerates. An internet that is streamlined, minimalist, formulaic and predictable, where every space is a market, every interaction a performance, and anything we create reduced to "content". 

Instead, we could foster a softer culture where explorations, sincerity and play are vital, a place for sharing and organizing, something that could outlive capitalism, irony poisoning and existential dissociation.

The internet permeates everything. It should be in control of the users, all interactions shouldn't be transactional. An internet of map making, play and multiplicities.

As a personal project, this acts as an unfinished and evolving map of my digital work. It's my node on the web, hyperlinked to other spaces. A place for practicing play, connecting ideas, following paths among the nodes and allowing other's to do so. The goal is to let the process be as organic as possible: node links are created not only manually but also automatically. The space can be traversed in any way.[CUT?] It grows and changes with me -- I like the idea of identity as plastic. 

## Digital Futures
The internet of platforms favor closed loops. When conglomerates with unfathomable resources are allowed to define how we use the internet, when they can set the standards so high, it's easy to contain all interactions to their domain. But technology should not be solely the domain of experts. We need to lower the threshold -- the web and technology in general could be even more accessible and democratic. The people at SOFTER phrased it well: [Softer digital futures](https://softer.website/softer).

As for culture: irony, deconstruction, cultural paranoia, post- and meta-whatever, they are powerful comedic tools. Meme culture has become unhinged and strange, and it's funny, but it's not an effective culture for reaching better futures -- it's the mentality of the end times. 
[Maybe something more hopeful is possible](https://beforewegoblog.com/purity-and-futures-of-hard-work-by-ada-palmer/), and/or we should just look for new weapons. 

Sincerity is key -- irony is only useful for deconstruction; we need to build as well.

## Internet of Play
Welcome personal websites, blogs, experiments, digital art projects, obscurities, things hidden, unfinished and the evolving. To break the bubble of the platforms, hyperlinks are vital. Explore actively and share your findings. We could define the map of the internet ourselves. [Search marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/) facilitates exploring the "small" internet.

The standards for web design needs to change. The current standards are corporate -- minimalist, subtle color schemes, [endlessly A-B tested for the best shade of blue](https://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html), psychological weaponizing of design. "Flawlessness" is expected. We become scared or vigilant whenever we encounter anything strange or in the style of "the old internet". Web design becomes unreasonably difficult.

[Ludic interfaces/designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_interface) is another option: the inherently playful and unexpected, a web that encourages exploration and creativity. This site tries to be structured but ludic. I encourage you to just follow links. There's nothing in particular that you need from here anyway.

## Learning in public
[Learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) is creating, sharing, and engaging in a collective feedback loop. A way of publishing anything, finished or unfinished, good or bad, with the purpose of evolving. Learn, interact, grow relationships. Ridding yourself of perfectionism. Allowing typos and mistakes. [The repository for this site is public.](https://github.com/palmdrop/hypervivid). You are free to view the history.

Share as you would write a notebook. Share your notes. You may forget, note to let it go, but with links you may encounter the note again. Someone else will. This is the idea of making maps and following paths: plot out associations, jump between nodes. The internet is a collective thing: this is how we could shape it. Make maps of the place we have and the place we'd like to create.
