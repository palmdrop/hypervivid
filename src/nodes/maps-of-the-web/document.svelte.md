Each day, I expand my network of private notes. On my desktop computer, my laptop, and on github, I have repositories of interconnected ideas, journal entries, thoughts, short story drafts, todo-lists, screenshots and links. I love taking notes like this: semi-chaotic, semi-organized, a mind-map sludge with a structure that only really emerges as I add links between the notes. My tool is [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), a suitably named piece of software. But there are countless others out there, each with its own philosophy.

I tend to sort my notes intuitively. The (virtual) folder structure is less important than the manual links between them. Recently I've been actively trying to approach note-taking as extended thinking -- notes as memory, association, metaphor, and connection.

I've been trying to avoid using note-taking for productivity-boosting. There's so much hype around the "second brain", but I don't want productivity to be my focus. My [hurry sickness](/nodes/raw-making) remains, and I'm still trying to escape it. I want notes (and websites) that surprise me, that aid with memory, creativity, play, and that show me paths between seemingly unconnected places. Note-taking, and thinking in general, shine when we allow for non-linear exploration, revisiting and revision, surprise and personal [world-building](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/05/worlding-raga-2-what-is-a-world/).

Physical note-taking is too restrictive. Notebooks get full, it's difficult to refer to old notes, and my handwriting is very, very bad. I love notes when they become like a web, a tangled map.

The core idea of the Internet mirrors this non-linear interconnectedness. But most of us stick to a corporately controlled fraction of the web: the Internet of Platforms, where "content" has to conform to a limited set of formats, and outgoing links are blocked or obstructed. ([I've written about this before.](/nodes/branches-and-connections))

The web needs the ["small"](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/), the ["soft"](https://softer.website/softer), and the ["poetic"](https://chiaski.github.io/poeticweb/). Tinkering with technology as omnipresent as the Internet should not be left to large media conglomerates or software experts. We need a *folk web*, a web that we truly inhabit, a space that is ours, where we can find new ways of relating to each other, new ways of being, a place to imagine new futures.

> A parenthesis about the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web): The semantic web is a collection of ideas about how to extend the hyperlink protocol with semantics -- a way of encoding meaning between links and entities on various sites. Semantics would make it possible for computers to understand the *meaning* behind the information on the web, and how it all fits together.

> Reading about this got me thinking about semantics in map-making and note-taking. My current notes are full of links but lack information about the meaning of those links. This site is the same. What happens when we imbue the edges with semantics, annotations, arrows and tooltips? Would this make it easier to follow trails of thoughts, to remember, and navigate? Or would it just be clutter? As with the semantic web, I do believe these enhanced links could enable software tools to understand and organize information in novel and useful ways -- we could create new, powerful tools.

I've been thinking about [map-making](/nodes/mappings) again. Maps as tools for thinking, note-taking, exploring concepts, researching projects, and sharing ideas. Maps help us see how things relate. Maps present information in a way that is easy to parse. Surprisingly, we barely use graphical mapping tools during our daily web browsing. The web is vast and chaotic; it's easy to get lost -- maps seem like the perfect tool for navigating, sharing, and learning about the web.

The browser is one of the most powerful multi-media viewers that we use daily. It's our primary portal to the web. But it's not very good at making maps. The only way to organize our web presence is through manually curated bookmarks, keeping track of open tabs, and occasionally glancing at the browser history. There's no sense of continuity, no way of telling how two open tabs relate, how you got from point A to point B. Both open tabs and the browser history are flat logs of past and present, but navigating the web is often erratic -- we glance at a page and close it immediately, we move quickly through links and back again, tabs multiply into the hundreds and suddenly we are completely lost.

The browser could help us actually navigate the web. A node graph similar to that presented by Vincent in [this post](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---tabs) could be used to keep track of where we are, how the currently open tabs relate, and where we have been. We could add semantics to the links between sites, create notes and connect them to a specific page, highlight a piece of text, or pull out an image into the map view. Browsing sessions could be organized in "spaces" or "projects", and we could add higher-level links between these sessions. The browser could also be enhanced with multiplayer capabilities, enabling us to share maps or bundle up snippets and site suggestions to send to friends.

I'd love a browser that helps us navigate outside the Internet of Platforms, which could aid in research, sharing, creativity and studies. A browser that helps us go on tangents without fear of losing the original idea, that more closely resembles how we think, take notes and intuitively *want* to use the web.

I've read a lot of blog posts about visions for the web. Most of the ideas I've touched on come from one of these places:

* [better tabs](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---tabs)
* [care packages](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---garden)
* [rabbit-hole browser](https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/)
* [improved browser history](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/browserhistory-2abad38022b1/)
* [folk interfaces](https://cristobal.space/writing/folk)
* [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
* [evergreen notes](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)
* [enhanced chatting](https://a9.io/glue-comic/)
* [the multiplayer web](https://interconnected.org/home/2021/03/22/social_attention)

I've started outlining some ideas for an experimental browser plugin that incorporates many of these ideas, along with some philosophies on note-taking, semantics and map-making. A tool that helps us navigate, remember and explore, that maps out our movements through the web, and allows for adding link semantics, notes, highlights, etc. All data would be stored locally unless explicitly bundled and shared with a friend.

> Some notes on memory: the Internet is continuously in flux. Links die, sites evolve. You may revisit a page and find it has changed or is no longer there. Maybe the browser can help you detect and deal with this situation. Or you have to update your map manually, similar to when physical environments evolve. Although this process tends to be slower -- rivers change shape, new roads and buildings are constructed, tectonic plates collide and mountains are formed.

Recently, I've noticed trends of hopefulness on the Internet. A move towards digital intimacy, new freedoms, softness, a culture of care, and visions of futures beyond capitalism. I want to integrate this culture into my art, my websites, and the software I build. I want to create things that help us imagine new ways of being.
