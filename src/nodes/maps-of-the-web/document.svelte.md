This post gathers some ideas and vague thoughts. Just trying to structure my thinking. Making thoughts public forces me to think a bit more. But this node remains vague, just a collection of losely coupled ideas on note-taking, maps, the web, websites, etc...

***

Each day, I expand my network of privaten notes. I only make a few public. On my desktop, laptop, on github, I have repositories of interconnected ideas, journal entries, thoughts, short story drafts, todo-lists, screenshots and links. I love taking notes like this: semi-chaotic, semi-organized, a mind-map sludge with a structure that only really emerges from the links between notes. I use [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), a suitably named piece of software, but there's countless others out there, each with its own philosophy.

I tend to sort my notes intuitively. The (virtual) folder structure of the notes is not as important as the manual links between them. Recently I've been actively trying to think, "is this idea related to something I've written before?" Trying to approach note-taking as extended thinking -- notes as memory, association, metaphor, connection.

There's some productivity hype around the potential of the "second brain". I've been trying to avoid optimizing my note-taking for productivity boosting. I don't want to be productive all the time, but my [hurry sickness](/nodes/raw-making) remains. Still trying to get away from that. I want notes (and websites) that surprise me, that aid with memory, that show me paths between seemingly unconnected places. Note-taking, and thinking, shines when we allow for non-linear exploration, for revisiting and revision, for surprise and personal [world-building](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/05/worlding-raga-2-what-is-a-world/).

Physical note-taking does not allow for this. Note-books get full, referring to old notes difficult, and my hand writing is way, way too bad. I love notes when they become like a website, like a web, a tangled map.

The core idea of the Internet mirrors this non-linear interconnectedness. *A hyperdimensional network*. But most of us stick to a corporately controlled fraction of the web: the Internet of platforms, where "content" has to conform to a limited set of formats, and outgoing links are blocked or obstructed. This is not a healthy web. ([I've written about this before.](/nodes/branches-and-connections))

The web needs the ["small"](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/), the ["soft"](https://softer.website/softer), and the ["poetic"](https://chiaski.github.io/poeticweb/). Tinkering with technology as omnipresent as the Internet should not be left to large media conglomerates or software experts. We need a *folk web*, a web that we truly inhabit, a space that is ours, where we can find new ways of relating to each other, new ways of being, a place to imagine new futures.

> A parenthesis about the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web): the semantic web is an idea for how to extend the hyperlink protocol with semantics -- a way of encoding meaning between links and entities on various sites. Semantics would make it possible for computers to understand how entities on different sites relate to each other. 

> Reading about this got me thinking about semantics in map-making and note-taking. My current notes are full of links but lack information about what the link means. This site is the same. What happens when we imbue the edges with semantics, annotations, arrows and tooltips? Would this make it easier to follow trails of thoughts, memory, navigation? Or would it just be clutter? As with the semantic web, I do belive these enhanced links could enable software tools to understand and organize the information in novel and useful ways.

I started thinking about [map-making](/nodes/mappings) again. Maps as tools for thinking, note-taking, exploring a concept, researching a project, sharing an ideas. Maps help us see how things relate. Maps present information in a way that is easy to parse. Surprisingly, we barely use any graphical mapping tools during our daily web browsing. The web is vast and chaotic and it's easy to get lost -- maps seem like the perfect tool for navigating, sharing, and learning about the web.

The web browser is one of them ost powerful multi-media viewers that we use daily. It's our primary portal to the web. But it's not very good at making maps. The only way to organize our web presence is through manually curated bookmarks, open tabs, and an occasional glance at the browser history. There's no sense of continuity, no way of telling how two open tabs relate, how you got from point A to point B. Both open tabs and the browser history are flat logs of past and present. Navigating the web is often erratic, we glance at a page and close it immediately, we move quickly through links and back again, the tabs multiply into the hundreds and suddenly we are completely lost. The original thought is there somewhere, unless we closed that tab by accident.

The browser could help us navigate the web. A node graph similar to that presented by Vincent in [this post](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---tabs) could be used to keep track of where we are, and how the current tabs relate. The history (closed tabs) could be viewed in the map as well, so we easily can backtrack. We could add semantics to the links between pages, create notes and connect them to a page, or highlight some text or pull out an image to view in the map view. We could organize our browsing in spaces, sessions or projects, and connect these to our liking. I belive a tool like this (although described in quite vague terms here) could help us find the way out of the internet of platforms. It would aid in doing research, studies, creativity. We could go on tangents without fear of losing the original idea. The browser could also be enhanced with multiplayer capabilities: making it possible to share maps, make bundles of useful snippets, show our friends the gardens, hedgemazes and digital forests we've found.

I've read a lot of blog posts about visions for the web. Most of the ideas I've touched on come from one of these places:

* [better tabs](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---tabs)
* [rabbit-hole browser](https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/)
* [improved browser history](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/browserhistory-2abad38022b1/)
* [folk interfaces](https://cristobal.space/writing/folk)
* [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
* [evergreen notes](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)
* [enhanced chatting](https://a9.io/glue-comic/)
* [the multiplayer web](https://interconnected.org/home/2021/03/22/social_attention)
* [care packages](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---garden)

I've started sketching on some ideas for an experimental browser plugin that combine aspects of these posts, along with philsophies on note-taking, semantics, and map-making. I would love a browser that helps us navigate, remember, share and explore. A tool that automatically tracks how you traverse through the web and plots it on a map, but allows for manual note-taking, annotated links, highlights, saved pictures, etc. All this data would of course only be stored locally, with the option of sharing it with friends only at will. A personal database of web explorations.

> Some notes on memory: the internet is continuously in flux. Links die, sites evolve. You may rivist a site and find it has changed, or is no longer there. Maybe the browser can help you detect and deal with this situation. Maybe you just have to update your map. This is no different from when physical environments evolve, although this process tend to be slower. Rivers change shape, new roads and buildings are created, tectonic plates collide and mountains are formed.

Recently, there seem to be trends of new hopefullness in Internet trends. A move towards intimacy, real connection, new freedoms, softness, care and futures beyond capitalism. I want to integrate this new culture in my art, my websites, and the software I make. I want to create things that help us find new ways of being.
