Each day, I expand my network of private notes. I have repositories of interconnected ideas, thoughts, journal entries, short story drafts, todo-lists, screenshots and links. My personal tool is called [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), but there're countless note-taking systems out there, each with a slightly different philosophy.

I sort my notes primarily using intuition. The actual (virtual) folder structure is not as important as the links between notes. Recently, I've been approaching note-taking as extended thinking. Notes as memory, association, metaphor, all gathered in a single space.

Like any tool, note-taking changes how we think. An [extended mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis) (I try not to think too much about "the second brain" and the ideas of using effective note-taking as productivity boosters -- I've been trying to get away from [hurry sickness](/nodes/raw-making) for a while now).

The problem with a notebook is linear limitations. Pages get filled up, and we move forward. Although we could jump around, add lines here and there on any page, the structure of the book enforces a linear approach. Notebooks also get full. Page references are messy and hard to lookup, especially if the pages you are referencing is present in another book. You cannot search, except by scanning with your eyes. My handwriting is *very* poor.

**The mind is not linear**. Presenting information in a linear, logical order takes tremendous effort, although it of course make information easily digestable. But no one thinks this way. Thinking is more fluid. The mind is a complex space where vague concepts and ideas blend together, associations form, new ideas emerge from the interplay of past knowledge, instinct, memory, everything.

I want note-taking that mirrors this. Notes as [nodes and edges](/nodes/node-graph) between them, nodes that are revisited, rewritten, reconnected, combined.

## a hyper-dimensional network
**A hyper-dimensional network**: the *internet* resembles a mind. The core of the internet is non-linear and interconnected. [I've written about this before.](/nodes/branches-and-connections) [and so has others??? links!!!]

[FORTSÃ„TT!]
Again, I've written before about how the internet shrinks. More and more is centrlized on a few large platforms. Visiting the rest of the internet becomes less intuitive, not something you do instinctively. Especially when we become used to specific "content" formats (like those on instagram, tiktok, youtube, medium, etc), or when outgoing links are blocked or obstructed (instagram does not allow links in descriptions, many sites warn you when leaving their site, making it seem dangerous).

The small/soft web is a healthy web. I firmly believe that. Tinkering with technology this omnipresent should not be left to the experts. I would love it if more people made sites of their own, started blogging, shared their findings, spoke and connected to each others outside coorporately controlled platforms. We seem to be at a stage where we desperately need to imagine new ways of being, relating, and thinking about the future. 

Using the internet is often like moving from place to place (site to site) by association or metaphor. A non-linear traversal, connecting dots. You read short texts, blog posts, follow tangents, tubmle down rabbit holes, then you steal, transform, expand. All the properly fascinating or revolutionary thoughts or ideas, be them cultural, social or economic, seem to have their roots in strange intersections. Cross-roads, breaking-points, kairos.

[semantic web - a parenthesis, created as it's own node? or fragment?]
> There was an idea for the web, called "the semantic web" or "web 3.0" (not to be confused with the crypto and NFT *web3*): a web where the hyperlink protocol was expanded to include entities and additional metadata. Semantics. A way of encoding relationships between sites or entities (items) on the sites, and what the relationship meant. Using a system like this, anything would be an API, weather data presented on one site could be consumed elsewhere, processed together with cosmological data from another source, to calculate the best times for star gazing. By providing semantics for the data presented on the web, it could more effectively be a space for distributed computation. 

> the problem with the current web is that non-human devices do not understand the meaning behind the information displayed on the web. Semantics could solve that, and thereby help us construct much more powerful tools for interpreting the web, processing data and organizing information. The semantic web becomes an interconnected network of entities (a site, an art piece, a product, a location, whatever) and meaningful connections between these things.

> I thought of this in relation to note-taking and just traversing the web. I've grown interested in maps, and how the map (here thought of in much more general terms than an approximation of spatial features in a specific area), and how semantics may provide value when taking notes. Associations, metaphors, connections, they all indicate which entities are connected, but what do the connections actually mean? What *is* the link? This feels like a crucial piece of information that most note-taking system are inherently lacking, although it's of course possible for the author to just annotate the link, indicating what the connection means. This annotaded link is hard to parse though, if we'd like to provide an overview of the information.

## Map-making
I've written about map-making before. I enjoy the concept, although it remains vague -- maps as tracings of space, mind-maps, maps as scientific graphs, maps as websites. Maps are extremely useful. We use them to explore the world, make mental models, organize our knowledge. Maps of space, maps of concepts, maps of structure. The map can be anything that may be used to document real-world things and enhance the information with associations, metaphors, and thoughts. The map helps us organize thoughts in a way that is easy to parse. 

My notes are a map of my mind, art, and the ideas I interact with. This site is me exploring the techniques involved in map-making. I experiment with linking notes together, making graphs, following old trails, pretty much the same thing I do in my personal notes, but alive on the web. The browser is endlessly fascinating to me, since it's the portal used to access the web, a multi-media viewer, and the primary tool used for connecting ideas.

> Maps made me interested in the concept of "worlding" as a tool for imagining new futures and shaping the present. [https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/05/worlding-raga-2-what-is-a-world/]

I still find this site a bit too restrictive. I want to explore some ideas that I lack in my note-taking tools as well. Nesting nodes is difficult, plotting up paths between them impossible, annotate the paths, imbuing the edges with meaning (semantics). I want hyper-nodes: nodes that change and evolve based on the contents they are linked to. I got this idea from my old manifesto page, which I no longer like. My ideas, opinions, mind, it always changes, in subtle and less subtle ways. The manifesto can't be static, but I can't bother updating it every month, adding or removing or rewriting. I want it to live. The *manifesto* as an idea is maybe too strict anyway, I don't really need it, but I would like to have an aggregation of ideas and thoughts visible as a map, a collection, or like an are.na channel. Something that evolves and grows as I add and edit on this site. A "manifesto" composed of fragment, semantic edges, fluid and fleeting, non-linear.

> I'm planning to make a backlog page for this site with future ideas. It will be linked here once it's created.

## Experimental Browsing
Recently, I've been reading about various visions for the web browser. What the browser is, what it is not, and what it could be. As a multi-media viewer, the browser is an extremely powerful tool for interacting with web content (or any content -- more and more native software is being created using the browser as their core (electron, etc)). The browser is vital. But it does not really satisfy all our needs. Some parts of moving around the web becomes messy. Most people end up with dosens or even hundreds of open tabs, most of which are probably forgotten, the context completely lost. The browser history is mostly useless, just a potentially embarassing trail a lot of people habitually seem to delete. Utilities for plannign where to go next, adding notes to specific sites, remembering how we got from point A to point B, are completely absent.

[note: this paragrpah repeats some of what will come next]
I started thinking about the browser's potential for helping us traverse, and map out, the web -- or the subset of the web we visit. The browser could remember paths, create visual representations of trails of thought through history and open tabs, and allow us to add semantics to the links we follow (what does it mean when we press a link -- is it a tangent, a source, additional information). The browser could be more social, allowing us to show others around, leave tags for others to see, collect packages of sites, media, whatever, to share with our friends. There are a lot of imaginative possiblities. I think the browser could evolve to work more closely to how we think, how we move, how we actually use the web and interact with the other people on it. It could be a tool for processing information more effectively, map-making, worlding, and imagining new futures.

Some things I've read about:
* maps of tabs
* improved browser history
* folk interfaces
* digital gardens
* the multiplayer web
* care packages

These ideas could also be extende with the map-making I previously spoke about: semantic connections between nodes in my personal web graph. Notes, saved images, user-defined paths between sites.

I have no plans on creating a new browser, but I think the extremely powerful browsers of today could be enhanced with effective browser plugins -- or a single plugin that combines many of the ideas discussed above. I would love to use something like this, and really think it could improve how we instinctively try to navigate web, and enable new ways of connecting ideas, sharing information, exploring, etc.

Imagine being able to visit a site, follow a few links, and then see your branching movements plotted on a map. You could annotate the links between sites, add notes, make highlights and save pictures. You could plot out paths of thoughts in the resulting node graph, and follow your thoughts back to remember where you were. This mak could be both a map of space and a map of time, ordered by site and by time (including both browser history (closed tabs), the present (opened tabs), and the future (links or sites marked by the users as "to visit")). You could package your map and send it to a friend, or show them the way live. You could have a minimap of your web browsing.

I want a browser that helps you navigate, that remembers, that allows you to make maps, jot down ideas, remember all your tangents, revisit, if you choose. Such browsing would be slower and more active, and likely is not always what you want. But when you want it, when actively exploring, when doing research, when following a trail of thought, when traversing the small, poetic web, I think this would very useful. I imagine an interface similar to [tabs](link!) and/or [folk interfaces](link!!!): a digital map of personal paths with scribbles in the margins.

> Note on memory: the internet is continuously in flux. Links die, site contents change. I'm not sure how to deal with these cases. I may rivist a site and find it has changed, or is no longer there. Maybe the browser can help you detect and deal with this situation. Maybe you just have to update your map. This is no different from when physical environments change. Rivers change shape, new roads and buildings are created, tectonic plates collide new mountains arise.

## This site as a proxy
This site has been a place to put my thoughts, photos, art, whatever. It's also been an experiment, a sandbox, a platform for web exploration. I tried to achieve a structure that I find dynamic enough, unlike my previous site which was too restrictive, with a predetermined set of categories. I want a site for multidimensional notes, a tool/practice that will force me to think, write, ship the work. A selective node graph of my mind -- a garden, habitat, my place on the web.

I want to use this space, and all the software/tools/art I make, as a tool for explorative imagining. It's hard, I mess up, sometimes I only want aesthetics (and that's fine), but that's what I want to try to do. I want to write and create and publish. [repeating stuff I already written... just link to other node?]. This browser plugin, I realize, is an extension of what I try to do on this site.

## Web gardens, web worlding, web habitats
Recently, I've noticed trends in internet culture moving us towards new ways of being and intercting on the web. People look for intimacy, real connection, new freedoms, more softness, more care, futures beyond capitalism. We have the culture of *are.na*, endless independent bloggers, digital artists, hopefulness in meme culture. I want to inhabit these new modes of thinking, this new culture, in my art, my sites, the software I make. I want to create tools that help us find new ways of being.
