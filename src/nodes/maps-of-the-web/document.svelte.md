Each day, I expand my network of private notes. On my desktop, my laptop, and my GitHub, I have repositories of interconnected journal entries, ideas, thoughts, short story drafts, todo-lists, screenshots and links. I love taking notes in a semi-chaotic, semi-organized way -- a mind-map sludge where structure only really emerges when I add links between the notes. My note-taking tool is [dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) (a suitably named piece of software) but there are countless others out there, each with its own philosophy.

I tend to sort my notes by intuition. The (virtual) folder structure is less important than links. Recently, I've been actively trying to approach note-taking as extended thinking -- notes as memory, association, metaphor, and connection. I try to avoid note-taking for productivity-boosting. There's lots of hype around the "second brain", but I don't want productivity to be my focus. My [hurry sickness](/nodes/raw-making) remains, still trying to escape it. I want notes that surprise me, that aid with memory, creativity, play, and that show me paths between seemingly unconnected places. I think note-taking, and thinking in general, shine when we allow for non-linear exploration, revision, surprise and personal [world-building](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/05/worlding-raga-2-what-is-a-world/).

The Internet embodies this non-linear interconnectedness: a complex network of hyperlinked, distributed sites. Yet most of us stick to a corporately controlled fraction of the web: the Internet of Platforms, where "content" has to conform to a limited set of formats, and outgoing links are blocked or obstructed. ([I've written about this before.](/nodes/branches-and-connections))

The web needs the ["small"](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/), the ["soft"](https://softer.website/softer), and the ["poetic"](https://chiaski.github.io/poeticweb/). Tinkering with technology as omnipresent as the Internet should not be left to large media conglomerates or software experts. We need a *folk web*, a web that we truly inhabit, where we can find new ways of relating to each other, new ways of being. A place to imagine new futures.

> A parenthesis about the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web): The semantic web is a collection of ideas about how to extend the hyperlink protocol with semantics -- a way of encoding meaning between links and entities on various sites. Semantics would make it possible for computers to understand what information on the web actually means, and how it all fits together, instead of just seeing raw data.

> Reading about this got me thinking about semantics in map-making and note-taking. My current notes are full of links but lack information about how the linked nodes relate. This site is the same. What happens when we imbue the edges with semantics, annotations, arrows and tooltips? Would this make it easier to follow trails of thoughts, to remember and navigate, or would it just be clutter? As with the semantic web, I believe these enhanced links could enable software to understand and organize information in novel and useful ways -- we could create new, powerful tools. 

I've been thinking about [map-making](/nodes/mappings) again. Maps as tools for thinking, exploration, research, and sharing ideas. Maps help us see how things relate by presenting information in a way that is easy to parse. Dendron can plot a graph that displays the connection between notes, which is quite useful to get an overview, seeing how notes relate, identifying groups, and following trails of thought. Surprisingly, we barely use any graphical mapping tools in our daily web browsing. The web is vast and chaotic; it's easy to get lost -- maps seem like the perfect tool for navigating, sharing, and learning about the web.

The browser is a powerful multi-media viewer, and our primary portal to the web. But it's not very good at making maps. The only way to organize our web presence is through manually curated bookmarks, open tabs, and an occasional glance at the browser history. There's no sense of continuity, no way of telling how two tabs relate, how you got from point A to point B. The open tabs and the browser history are flat logs of past and present, unable to capture our erratic movements through the web -- we glance at a page and close it immediately, we move quickly through various links and then back again, we search for something and start a new trail. Suddenly, the tabs have multiplied into the hundreds and we are completely lost.

[Vincent](https://garden.vincentli.space/about) has a great [blog post](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---tabs) about a hypothetical tab management map. A similar map could be used to keep track of where we are, how we got there, and where we've been. Semantic links could connect sites we visit, notes could be appended to specific pages, text could be highlighted and images could be pulled out into the map view. Using "spaces" or "projects" we could organize our browsing sessions, and add higher-level links between them. Multiplayer capabilities could enable us to share maps, or bundle snippets and site suggestions before we send them to a friend.

I'd love a browser that guides me out of the Internet of Platforms, that facilitates research, exploration and creativity. A browsing experience that more closely resembles how we think, take notes and intuitively *want* to use the web.

> Some notes on memory: the Internet is continuously in flux. Links die, sites evolve. You may revisit a page and find it has changed or is no longer there. Maybe the browser could help you detect and deal with this. Or maybe you have to update your map manually, like we have to do when physical environments evolve -- rivers change shape, new roads are constructed, tectonic plates collide and mountains are formed.

Lately, I've read a lot of blog posts about visions for the Internet. *What the web could be*. Most of the ideas I've touched on in this post come from one of these places:

* [better tabs](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---tabs)
* [care packages](https://garden.vincentli.space/making-a-place-on-the-web---garden)
* [rabbit-hole browser](https://szymonkaliski.com/projects/cartographist/)
* [improved browser history](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/browserhistory-2abad38022b1/)
* [folk interfaces](https://cristobal.space/writing/folk)
* [digital gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
* [evergreen notes](https://maggieappleton.com/evergreens)
* [enhanced chatting](https://a9.io/glue-comic/)
* [the multiplayer web](https://interconnected.org/home/2021/03/22/social_attention)

I've started outlining some ideas for an experimental browser plugin that incorporates many of these thoughts, along with some ideas on note-taking, semantics, and map-making. Ideas for a tool that helps us navigate, remember and explore -- making personal maps of our movements through the web.

Recently, I've noticed trends of hopefulness on the Internet. A move towards digital intimacy, softness, cultures of care, and visions for futures beyond capitalism. This I want to integrate into my art, my sites, and the software I build. I want to create things that help us imagine new ways of being.
