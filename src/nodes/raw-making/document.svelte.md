I have [*hurry sickness*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuIZuUCKd84). I walk at a fast pace from point A to point B. *Productivity* hangs around in the back of my mind. I cut corners, take micro-shortcuts when making coffee in the morning. This happens automatically and involuntarily. I'm not in a rush, but I'm still optimizing. Not sure what I'm optimizing--time? We all know what time is. 

It's not just me. This is in our culture, economics, social media platforms, self-help books, and mindfulness apps. 

I don't want to be in a rush. I shouldn't need to. I'm not even chasing clout, internet fame, or persistent growth. I'm not grinding toward a well-defined final goal. I've got a stable income, I don't need this additional layer of stress for my survival. 

The involuntary productivity mindset seeps into my creative projects. What I *want* is for everything to be vibe, floating, myself bathing, not wading around in circles. But if a creative project takes too much time without a constant flow of presentable output, I get stressed out, subtly. I shouldn't, though. I want art to be about endless process, meandering, [map-making](/nodes/mappings)--sometimes not even art, but raw, stupid making. I love to create but the love is often spoiled, the fertilizer is foul, I got to find other grounds.

As practice, I shall publish more, without increasing my pace. The idea is to be less scared of criticism, less restrained. Friends and I sometimes "joke" about the *[cringe](/nodes/cringe-core) panopticon*: the fear of being called out as cringe which paralyzes us. The same goes for the fear of being called out as [pretentious](https://youtu.be/dMpJFbwR8OM?t=667). But the (theoretical) consequences do not justify that fear.

So I will be lazy and bold. Non-productive and foolish. Create for no reason, or [whatever reason I might encounter](https://www.are.na/samuel-hardman/pipedreams). Play. Garden. Vibrate in a stupid hole. Spew stream-of-consciousness-semi-incoherent words like these.
