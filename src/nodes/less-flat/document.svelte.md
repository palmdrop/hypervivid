I sometimes feel undefined, husk-like, or unreal. Writing, coding, or otherwise creating alleviates this. I'm thinking about engaging in crafts as a tool for self-exploration. But not just exploration: also map-making and terraforming. Self-discovery, sure, but as we all know by now: the mind's plastic, regardless of age. I think writing, creating art, and working on your craft, may aid in changing the shape of the self, if a hint of directed attention is mixed in. This is comforting to me.

I've been trying to think about digital and generative art as virtual gardening, or landscaping. Something that grows and evolves. It helps mitigate the semi-involuntary desire to constantly produce and perform. Maybe I should think about *my self* the same way. I do like the idea of identity as evolving and constantly plastic.

I write this with the purpose of priming myself. I want to write and try to think more. To feel less flat.
