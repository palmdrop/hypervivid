I've played with the simple [substrates](https://palmdrop.github.io/substrates/) web app for a long time. I wrote the app as a coding exercise, and as a simple way of building generative shaders that I could embed anywhere. Software like TouchDesigner is powerful, but cannot run natively on the web. I wanted something that could live anywhere. [Read more in a previous post...](/nodes/substrates)

Over time, I collected a large set of generative shader configurations scattered about on different web pages, littering my downloads folders, stored for later use. I went through them all, picked the good ones, and wrote stream-of-consciousness descriptions for each. I wanted a documentation page, where I could easily browse them all. The descriptions were mostly a creative exercise.
