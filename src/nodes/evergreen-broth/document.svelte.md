I've been working on an semi-abstract web project. The purpose and form remains vague. I just got the urge to play with web-native art and unconventional narrative techniques. The site still grows. I try to approach it as a garden (*evergreen*).

<ParagraphLarge style="text-align: center">

*[~ evergreen broth ~](https://evergreen-broth.com)*

</ParagraphLarge>

<ExternalIframe 
  width="100%" 
  src="https://evergreen-broth.com" 
  title="Vibing and Being"
  style="
    max-height: 80vh; 
    aspect-ratio: 0.707
  "
/>

<ParagraphLarge style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1em">

*[~ evergreen broth ~](https://evergreen-broth.com)*

</ParagraphLarge>

Sharing fiction on the web is weird. Swedish is my native tongue. Forcing myself to write in english might reveal the interplay between the languages in my thinking. Some writing is translation, some is not. Nothing is completely compartmentalized, etc etc etc.
