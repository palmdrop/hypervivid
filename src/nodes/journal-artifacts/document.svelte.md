A small project based on *journal artifacts*: short phrases, words, or quotes that I jot down during the day. The artifacts are not extracts from my "actual" journaling but intentionally vague, timestamped micro-records. Re-reading sometimes brings back that state of mind, thought, or feeling. Other times I recall nothing, and try to associate instead.

I started doing this as a simple meditative practice. A tiny ritual of abstract notes. I enjoy making lists, and maybe I hoped for serendipity--this project leading to something else--and also, I was thinking about memory prompts: how little is needed to bring back a memory. Scrolling through this list is easier and more fun than sifting through journal notes. And if I'd like, I could use these fragments to re-enforce certain memories, feelings, or ideas.

I want to strengthen and evolve my sense of memory. It often [feels fleeting.](/nodes/less-flat).

The artifacts didn't have to be public, but they're vague and do not reveal anything personal. And I wanted to contribute to the [poetic web](https://chiaski.github.io/poeticweb/): the web of small, "useless", personal websites--shared, poetic rooms.

The project is partly inspired by [still-here.net](https://still-here.net). I found this site a while back and I don't know what it means. I don't know who the author is or what the fragments represent. Perhaps the approach is similar to mine, or entirely different: is it a log book, an art project? I found it oddly inspiring. I love finding things like these: scraps of people, unexplained and beautiful and strange.
